#' rcoursetools - A Set Of Tools Useful For Teaching Courses.
#'
#' When teaching a course, one faces a standard set of tasks such as
#' \itemize{
#'   \item creating slides
#'   \item creating excercises
#'   \item creating homeworks
#'   \item grading homeworks
#'   \item answering student questions
#'   \item creating exams
#' }
#' Most of these tasks are repetitive and hence tools which support the
#' teachers in completing these tasks are believed to be valueable in
#' the sense that they take away some of the burden from the teachers
#' giving them more time to spend with students.
#'
#' The package rcoursetools provides a set of tools which are meant to
#' help teachers in every step of the creation of a new course.
